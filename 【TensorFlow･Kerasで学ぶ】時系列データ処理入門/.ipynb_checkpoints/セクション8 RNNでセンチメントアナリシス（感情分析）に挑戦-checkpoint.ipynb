       " 'for me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time  no exceptions  james cameron has proved himself time and time again that he is a master storyteller  through films such as aliens  the abyss and both terminators it is clear that he was a brilliant and confidant director as far as action and science  fiction goes  he sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film  but titanic is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance  the film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises  plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows  the story of the famed voyager sinking on her maiden voyage is legend so the challenge was for cameron to make a truthful  interesting and entertaining film about it  the acting is wonderful as leonardo dicaprio who plays jack and kate winslet who plays rose became superstars overnight with the release of this film and in most films i get annoyed when the supporting characters aren  t given a lot to do but in this film it is more purposeful because as an elderly rose  gloria stuart  tells her story it is quickly apparent that it is rose  s and jack  s story alone  no one else  emotionally it is entirely satisfying and can leave no dry eye in a theater or home  the music has become iconic and legendary  it is composer james horner  s finest soundtrack ever and evokes so much from the film and the audience  the song after so long has become annoying but i still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this film is  only one problem  the usual james cameron problem  is the dialogue which is memorable but in a bad way as in how cheesy it is at points but all that aside  james cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that sweeps you away on a journey of a lifetime  my heart won  t go on from this one   ',\n",

also the big year in the release of titanic  one of the biggest films of all time a tale about the ship of dreams  about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster  i don  t think anybody could have expected titanic to be as huge as it was  the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans     of them being teenage girls  i was   years old at the time  and of course saw the movie multiple times  it was the film that made me believe that the love that jack and rose shared was so real and beautiful  at the time i felt that titanic could do no wrong  of course i grew up and didn  t watch the film since i was    a couple years ago i saw the film on dvd for     and figured that it was a good price and to see what i thought about the movie now  was it worth the hype  was it really the best movie of all time  was that leonardo  s real nose  ok  i know that  s silly to say  but i did re  watch the film  being completely honest here  titanic is a great movie  best movie of all time  no  just depends on your idea of a good movie  but titanic delivered in romance  humor  disaster  emotions and never let us go on this maiden voyage   br    br   the film starts with brock lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the rms titanic  searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the heart of the ocean  unsuccessful  they instead discover a drawing of a young woman reclining nude  wearing the heart of the ocean  dated the day the titanic sank      year  old rose dawson calvert learns of the drawing  and contacts lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing  she and her granddaughter elizabeth  lizzy  calvert visit lovett and his skeptical team on his salvage ship  when asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace  rose calvert recalls her memories aboard the titanic  revealing for the first time that she was rose dewitt bukater  in      the upper  class    year  old rose boards the ship with her fianc  cal hockley and her mother  ruth dewitt bukater  both of whom stress the importance of rose  s engagement to cal since the marriage will mean the eradication of the dewitt  bukater debts while they have the outward appearance of the upper  class  rose and her mother are financially broke  distraught and frustrated by her engagement to the controlling cal and the pressure her mother is putting on her to go through with the marriage  rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern  before she leaps  a drifter and artist named jack dawson intervenes  jack and rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life  and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching their bond deepens when they leave a stuffy first  class formal dinner of the rapport  building wealthy for a much livelier gathering of irish dance  music and beer in third  class  but after cal  s servant informs him of rose  s whereabouts   rose is forbidden from seeing jack again  however  after witnessing a woman encouraging her seven  year  old daughter to behave like a  proper lady  at tea  rose defies him and her mother  asking jack to sketch her nude and wearing only the heart of the ocean  an engagement present from cal  after a beautiful moment together in the very first backseat fun time  they go to the deck of the ship   br    br   they then witness the ship  s fatal collision with an iceberg  after overhearing the ship  s lookouts discussing how serious the collision is  rose tells jack they should warn her mother and cal  meanwhile  cal discovers rose  s nude drawing and her taunting note in his safe  so he frames jack for stealing the heart of the ocean by having lovejoy plant it in jack  s pocket  upon learning cal intends to leave jack to die below deck  rose runs away from him and her mother to rescue him  jack and rose return to the top deck  cal and jack  though enemies  both want rose safe  so they persuade her to board a lifeboat  but after realizing that she cannot leave jack  rose jumps back on the ship and reunites with jack in the ship  s first class staircase  jack and rose return to the top deck  the lifeboats have gone  and the ship finally goes down into the freezing atlantic taking jack and rose down   br    br   so does titanic live up to it  s hype  i still say that this is a great movie to watch  i think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and everyone was in love with the movie  but it has great acting  amazing effects  a well  written story and still looks flawless  love it or hate it  you have to admit this movie didn  t get a lot of hype just because of leo  s baby face or kate  s amazing ability to cry on sight  this film is something special  it will always hold a special place in my heart  it has too seeing that i saw this film  times in the theater when it was released  but all that aside  i do recommend this movie  it  s a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day   br    br         ',\n",

       " 'titanic directed by james cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the titanic  the plot is simple  noncomplicated  or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense  the end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film  but the love story is an interesting one  however  kate winslett is wonderful as rose  an aristocratic young lady betrothed by cal  billy zane   early on the voyage rose meets jack  leonardo dicaprio   a lower class artist on his way to america after winning his ticket aboard titanic in a poker game  if he wants something  he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries  the two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the titanic primarily through their eyes   br    br   the movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures  that sunk with the titanic  which has recently occurred  one of the survivors of the titanic  rose dewitt bukater  who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search  she gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the titanic  with this  the scene shifts to southhampton  ireland where the titanic set sail from on april        as all the passengers are boarding  after another stop on the irish coast titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the atlantic bound for new york  historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful  but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy cal hockley and falls in love with third class passenger  jack dawson  captain smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the white star line director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in new york on thursday night and not on friday morning as planned  smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty  two years of experience to stretch the titanic  s legs out to full speed  the titanic had reports that the waters in the atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs  but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie  on april        at       an iceberg was sighted  they attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film  the portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate  the crew of titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until     when the lights finally failed  the lights of the california were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to titanic  s many pleas for help  the california had tried earlier in the day to warn titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but titanic had brushed them off causing the california to turn off its radio and leave the titanic on its own  the first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship  overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too  the word of white star line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking  also  the metal that was used to build the titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold  which were experienced the night titanic sank to be extremely brittle  overall  the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the titanic   br    br   many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship  the core group of rose  jack  cal  and rose  s mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time  yet many characters such as the unsinkable molly brown captain edward smith the ship designer  thomas andrew the white star line representative  bruce ismay and all of the titanic  s officers were real  the maiden voyage was going to be captain edward smith  s last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards  he had been a part of the white star line since     where he worked his way up to his status as the millionaire  s captain when the titanic sunk  the portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol  he is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that james cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officer  s former canadian hometown  as shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lower  class passengers from non  english speaking nations  in addition  officer lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted  the old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the strauss   not wanting to leave her husband  s side mrs  strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the titanic  furthermore  mr  goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best  the richest man on the ship  john jacob astor  who owned most of manhattan died nonetheless as well  but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat  in addition  molly brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the carpethia that picked the survivors of titanic up from the water  her ticket on the titanic had cost over four  thousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke  all of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware  the gymnasium  which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs  the wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent re  creation of the post  victorian era of      the rich at this time practically ruled everything  as the women  s suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet  women during this time often married for financial security as rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as cal wished for rose to do  the rich did not take well to new money  such as molly brown as depicted  everything of the time was very formal  women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes  smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes  which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with rose in the movie  men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes  women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society  although james cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of titanic coupled with two years spent cross  referencing the history of the titanic and few liberties were taken  the beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking   br    br   a recognizable message can be seen in the movie titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise  the director  james cameron  shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in people  s lives  everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the titanic on that fateful night  in addition  this film is a reflection of the      s when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the titanic  only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual titanic been found and explored  this movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed  however  the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed  there have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in titanic but all have failed  as it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter   br    br   technically the film is very well done  to get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie  in addition  a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean  cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside titanic as anyone has in the   years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship  furthermore  throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of titanic to the scene of titanic during its actual voyage  this shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner  at the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the european coast on titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film   br    br   titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art  a true epic  like most history novels  we know the ending  but it doesn  t take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture  certain aspects of this film are academy award material including costuming  sound  cintematography  and editing  if you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early      s and how they face disaster  then this

a director that was unable to complete his vision would have the opportunity to have his vision restored  it seems like a winning situation  and then you start watching this assembly of footage and you realize this  esoteric dream  is a very real nightmare of sloppiness and incompetence  while it  s entirely possible that no movie could compete with the finished perfect version each of us has imagined over the years it really should have been a thrill to finally see this project  and it is only a very few times   br    br   you know things are shaky when the very first bit of text on screen looks like home brew computer graphics  but then we start seeing new footage  alternates from superman  the movie for the trial  and that first bit of hesitation fades away  hey  this is pretty neat  things are alright for these few fleeting moments until we see footage from stm intermixed with new effects for this project  and it doesn  t convince at all  and from this point on  it never ever lets up  it  s probably not right to judge a movie because of bad visual effects  but when this is supposedly the direct follow up to a movie whose tag line was  you  ll believe a man can fly  it  s difficult to believe anything shown on screen here  the best effects in this are from the original productions   br    br   another issue with this re  cut  a lot of it just doesn  t make sense  the only reason any of it really works is because we  ve all seen the theatrical version of superman ii  a movie that does make sense  lester  s superman ii fills in the holes of this assembly  part of this could be because donner didn  t get to complete shooting  the other part could be because the makers of this project were intent on using as little lester material as possible  what we end up with is an assembly of footage that makes superman iv look airtight and coherent   br    br   after viewing this  one gets the sense that while lester was faithful and comfortable using donner material  michael thau and his team were extremely disrespectful towards anything filmed by lester  the best scenes in the donner cut are the ones lifted relatively intact from the released version of superman ii  that includes the moon sequence and the diner sequence  not ironically  both were filmed by donner  but anything else from that movie filmed by lester is re  edited in such a hasty fashion  that it now makes lester seem like a ham fisted know nothing  while lester honored the donner material  lester here is thrown under the bus   br    br   so is there anything good in this release  well marlon brando is in it  and that  s neat to see  in fact watching any of the material shot by donner is neat since it was all filmed at the same time as superman  the movie  but that only highlights the problems of this release  any of the major scenes  really just lois jumping and scenes with marlon brando  would have been better served as completed scenes in a deleted scenes section  instead they are shoe horned into a nonsensical narrative with inferior performances  many alternate takes from familiar scenes are used  sloppy edits and bad decisions   br    br   watch the opening scene at the daily planet  why are we looking at jackie cooper  s back as he calls for lois and clark  at the end why do we have lois walking into her dark apartment only to have that followed by jackie cooper walking into a dark bathroom turning the lights on  i was initially confused by this  because i expected to see lois  the entire assembly is filled with questionable choices like this   br    br   battle scenes are a mess too  with no geography between cuts  it  s just random action  of course  the major action scenes were shot by lester and his material is only used as a bridge to the next set of donner outtakes or alternates  they should have used more of lester  s footage  but probably had too much pride to admit that   br    br   the sloppiness extends to the military missile as well  as noted elsewhere  the missile shown in the donner cut bears the designation  xk    while we all know it  s the  xk      a blind man in stm knows that  the producers of this assembly  who tried so hard to honor the original film  dropped the ball less than five minutes in and that mistake is indicative of the quality of the entire production  for all the supposed care that was put into this  the final product has an air of shoddiness to it that is inescapable   br    br   the entire affair would probably be easier to digest if warner  s didn  t make this a separate release here in the states  as it is  we  re expected to pay for what is essentially a bonus disc of deleted scenes with a  play all  option  it  s really only worth one viewing so that we can finally see the legendary cut scenes  but after that initial viewing  i expect that this will be an excellent magnet for dust and little else  i know after my experience of watching this  i had new respect for lester  s version  it  s by no means perfect  but lester realized the deficiencies that were in the script that stand out here in bold relief  he managed to make a movie that has entertained for many years and will continue to do so  while this new re  cut will most likely only be remembered as a footnote in that films history   ',\n",

nauseating  now  one of my favorite parts of the short was the dancing kireihana  nice music  fun to watch  that  s changed with the bellossom  the music sucked for one  but on top of that  they had all the pokmon talk during the music  which turned out to be jumpy  annoying  and just unnecessary  oh  and then there  s the poliwhirl who thinks he  s a poliwrath  you  d think that guys that work with these characters constantly would at least learn what they are  basically  not much could save this little ill fated dub  which is very unfortunate considering its potential  but  i haven  t touched on the worst of it yet   br    br   you  d think that the warning signs would  ve been apparent to me when i received my issue of nintendo power  for some unfathomable reason  i had been placing some faith in  kids and the wb  my thoughts were well  they screwed up on the first movie  but the second is different as far as the theme goes  so they should do well   that in mind  i just didn  t pay attention to the warning signs i encountered in the theaters when the trailers said  you will believe that one person can make all the difference   with the way they said that at every turn  i was hoping that this would not turn into a moral fest like msb did at the end of the english version  then comes nintendo power  in which i see all my fears realized in the words the main feature  the power of one   at that point  i became a bit more uneasy  the power of one    not a good sign  however  i still kept some of my false faith  big mistake   br    br   sitting in the theater  i was literally getting stomach cramps watching another movie which i loved in japanese being turned into complete and utter junk  i hear comments that say it was better because the moral was more subtle  i can see a point in that since they didn  t pander this thing  repeating it over and over like in msb  however  it did more damage than anything else in this movie  first of all  the legend that was read throughout was changed a bit to read the world turns to ash   ah hah  so  ash is the chosen one  whatever  in the japanese version  the inhabitants of arshia needed a pokmon trainer to carry out their traditional ceremony  this time  he  s the chosen one  a greater way that this did damage was to lugia  lugia was one of the coolest characters in a pokmon movie     when the movie was about lugia  in this one  lugia is forced to take a back seat to ash  in the scene where they  re flying back to the main island  lugia and ash are discussing the conditions of lugia  s existence  not that ash is going to make all the difference  overall in this category  ash wasn  t really the one person  that would make the difference  since he was helped by many along the way   br    br   a lot of the other stuff is kind of nit picking  furura  s flute song wasn  t nearly as sweet and enjoyable as the japanese one  jirarudan  s speech to them saying his collection started with a mew card   ugh  even worse  misty  s outrage originally concerned the way moltres and zapdos were being held  why didn  t you put them in pokballs when you caught them  this is like caging them to be displayed   much different from whining about him thinking pokmon are things to be collected like stamps  if there were any real redeeming values in this  they came from team rocket  some pretty funny lines  not really to make me laugh out loud  but more to make me giggle and slightly ease the pains in my stomach  well  that was officially the last american pokmon movie i  m going to see  i  ve imported the third one and find it very enjoyable  i would rather not see another japanese movie be ruined in the same fashion as the first two  i  ll be importing the fourth one as well  forget you  kids wb and  kids  you have forsaken me for the last time   ',\n",
